# Examples getting started

Here you can find a lot of differents examples in their respectives folder. I recommend use a virtial enviroments with the requeriments.txt


## How to read the examples

Depend or your device orientation exist devices with only digital terminal or with only analog input terminals, etc but I recommend follow this order:

1. **capabilities examples**
2. **ai examples**
3. **di examples**
4. **ci examples**
5. **do examples**
6. **co examples**
7. **TDMS examples**

## More advanced uses

When you get the hang of using your DAQ devices, you'll probably want to integrate this into a more complex Python application.  
To do that, it is very useful to know how to control the PCI board in parallel to a Python application.
You can find some examples using multiprocessing package in **multiprocessing folder**.  
If you want a **GUI** in Python, you have some options, but here I show you a simple application using the [Dash Plotly](https://plotly.com/examples/) package. This implements localhost and you can create an application that runs in your Internet browser. You can find this examples in **dash folder**.
 

8. **Multiprocessing**
9. **Dash**
